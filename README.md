# Welcome to b4db1r3's Repo!

Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm b4db1r3, a moniker that, with a little creativity, translates to "bad bird" â€“ a play on my real-life name. As a team leader in a development role, I enjoy learning and diving hands-on into coding. Though my professional life doesn't involve tweaking or jailbreaking, it's a passion that I indulge in during my personal time.

## ðŸ“± Jailbreaking Journey

My journey with jailbreaking started with the iOS 4 on an iPhone 4. Since then, it's been impossible to go back to a stock iPhone. The world of jailbreaking offers unparalleled potential and quality-of-life improvements that, in my opinion, can't be matched by any other system. Beyond iPhones, my tech enthusiasm has led me to jailbreak various devices, including PlayStation consoles and Android devices. To me, this is what being a true tech nerd is all about!

## ðŸ›  This Repo: A Labor of Love

This repository is a testament to following one's passion. I've been creating tweaks for almost a year now, teaching myself through YouTube, ChatGPT-4, open-source projects, and good old trial and error.

### My Main Tweaks

- **[RGProud](https://github.com/b4db1r3/RGProud)**: Turn your lockscreen's lock icon into a visual lock state indicator: Red for locked, Green for unlocked.
- **[Tappy!](https://github.com/b4db1r3/Tappy)**: A single tap on the time reveals the date, with an option for a second tap to display the week, all with a smooth fade animation.
- **CozyBadges**: An extension of NoisyFlake's open-source tweak. I've adapted it for rootless environments, injected new life with spotlight injection, and have more features on the horizon.

## ðŸ§° What's Next?

I'll update this README periodically to reflect new developments and share more about the tweaks I'm working on. The challenge of creating something new is tough but incredibly rewarding.
