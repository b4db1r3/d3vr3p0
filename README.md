Hey!

Im b4db1r3 (which is 'bad bir[b]d', which is, a translation of my name I guess if you have some creativity)! 


Im just like to learn stuff and get my hands dirty (with code you fools).
Im a team leader in real life in a development position, but im not touching in any of this in my job.
I jailbroke all my iPhones since iOS 4 days, using iPhone 4. 
Since then I cannot use stock iPhones anymore, the potential of jailbreak is unimaginable, satisfying & you can't get any tweaks QOL tweak in probably any other system. This is something truly unique. 
I always had a passion for tech, in every other aspects, I jailbroke my ps2, ps3, ps4, switch, androids.. what can be said more? Im a cool nerd. 
This repo, is my personal succsess of doing what I truly love. 
Creating tweaks is to be honest, very hard, and probably not so worth it time wise. 
But since im a little curious, and I have my own pace - I not in a rush to develop. 
I have creating tweaks for almost a year now, im learning all by myself thru YouTube, ChatGPT-4, Open source tweaks, and mainly from trial and error. 


Right now, my main tweaks are:

1) RGProud - Turn your lockscreen proud lock into a visual representation of the lock state. Red = locked, Green = unlocked.

2) Tappy! - Tap the time to reveal the date. Can be configured to 2 taps action, so you can show the date with 1 tap and the week with 2 taps. Using a nice fade animation.

3) CozyBadges - a NoisyFlake tweak that left open source, with NF leaving the JB community, I update the tweak to update rootless environment with some adjustments to the code. I am also added some new features such as also spotlight injection, and more to come. 


I will edit this README once a  while to share the things. I have some more unreleased tweaks that Im working on, it's pretty hard, but I get the whole idea.
